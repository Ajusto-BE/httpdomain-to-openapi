# httpdomain-to-openapi

Generates OpenAPI documentation from code documented according to the
[httpdomain syntax](https://sphinxcontrib-httpdomain.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Usage

- Modify the path mentioned in APP_DIR variable from *httpdomain-to-openapi.py* file to match the location of the Flask app directory from your local machine
- Run *httpdomain-to-openapi.py* file with Python
```
python3 httpdomain-to-openapi.py --app app_example:app --title '50 Five' --version v5.25.0
```

**Command options** detailed:
1. -a, --app
- *type*: mendatory
- *description*: indicates the Flask app for which to collect the endpoints that need to be documented according the OpenAPI Specification
2. -t, --title
- *type*: optional
- *description*: adds a given title to the generated OpenAPI documentation
3. -v, --version
- *type*: optional
- *description*: adds a given version to the generated OpenAPI documentation

## Limitations

This program does not cover certain Flask functionality such as
[pluggable views](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/views/)
and most likely blueprints.

Support for this could be quite straightfowardly by consulting the,
`sphinxcontrib-httpdomain` source, in particular `flask_base.py`.
However, this functionality was not needed when writing
`httpdomain-to-openapi` for its initial use case.
