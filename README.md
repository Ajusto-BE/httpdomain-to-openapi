# docstrings-to-openapi

Generates an OpenAPI document from a python web framework's defined controllers/paths/view docstrings.


## Supported Frameworks

Currently only flask is provided, but any other python web framework can be added.


## Docstring Styles

* [httpdomain](docs/httpdomain.md)
* [openapi-block (yaml)](docs/openapi-block.md)


## Dependencies

* PyYAML


## Install

docstrings-to-openapi will most likely need to be installed in the app's virtualenv in order to run correctly.

Since this is not on pypi, for the time being, it can be installed by cloning the project to your machine or using the pip feature from installing from a url:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/saffronsoftware/httpdomain-to-openapi.git
# Remember to have your project's virtualenv activated
(my-project-venv) $ pip install -e ./httpdomain-to-openapi
```
or
```
(my-project-env) $ pip install -e git+ssh://git@github.com/saffronsoftware/httpdomain-to-openapi.git
```

And once successfully installed, it can be ran:
```
(my-project-env) $ docstrings-to-openapi
```

#### Flask

```

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a APP, --app APP     The flask app import name in python
  -b APP_DIR, --app-dir APP_DIR
                        The directory where the flask app source is
  -c COMPONENTS_FILE, --components-file COMPONENTS_FILE
                        Include a components file with the generated OpenAPI doc
```


## Limitations

This program does not cover certain Flask functionality such as
[pluggable views](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/views/)
and most likely blueprints.

Support for this could be quite straightfoward by consulting the, `sphinxcontrib-httpdomain` source, in particular `flask_base.py`.
However, this functionality was not needed when writing `httpdomain-to-openapi` for its initial use case.

OpenAPI defined components are not supported at this time.
