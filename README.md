# docstrings-to-openapi

Generates an OpenAPI document from a python web framework's defined controllers/paths/view docstring.


## Supporting Frameworks

Currently only flask is provided, but any other python web framework can be added.


## Docstring Styles

* [httpdomain](docs/httpdomain.md)
* [openapi-block (yaml)](docs/openapi-block.md)


## Dependencies

* PyYAML

  -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                        The app API version to show on the OpenAPI doc
```


#### Flask

```
usage: cli.py flask [-h] -a APP -b APP_DIR

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a APP, --app APP     The flask app import name in python
  -b APP_DIR, --app-dir APP_DIR
                        The directory where the flask app source is
```


## Limitations

This program does not cover certain Flask functionality such as
[pluggable views](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/views/)
and most likely blueprints.

Support for this could be quite straightfoward by consulting the, `sphinxcontrib-httpdomain` source, in particular `flask_base.py`.
However, this functionality was not needed when writing `httpdomain-to-openapi` for its initial use case.

OpenAPI defined components are not supported at this time.
